# ‚ö†Ô∏è About
This is a practical cosmetics website project developed as part of the Alura course.

Integrated the Swiper JS plugin for the image carousel (in responsive mode).

## üöÄ Development Experience
During the creation process, I faced challenges such as implementing interactive features with JavaScript and integrating plugins like Swiper JS to enhance the user experience in responsive mode. I'm very happy to have made it

Throughout development, I learned the importance of code organization. Although I didn't have much experience, I learned a lot and added some comments in _CSS_ to make it easier for those who collaborate or even for me in the future. Furthermore, the experience of working with images and design gave me even more knowledge in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCSS.

I'm proud of the end result. It was a very intense week and I hope that this project will not only demonstrate my technical skills, but also convey my passion for the field of technology.

This project was the first one I put into practice since I started the course, with the Desenvolvimento Botic√°rio program, I am very grateful, I am very grateful for their project; It‚Äôs amazing, both the mentors and Alura‚Äôs course. It's a great opportunity.
